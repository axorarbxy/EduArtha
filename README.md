# Rethinking Educational Translation

Most translation tools focus on converting words from one language to another.

EduArtha focuses on something more important—**understanding**.

Educational content often contains technical terminology and abstract concepts that become even more confusing after direct translation. EduArtha uses Google's **Gemma 4** to explain concepts in simple Hindi, helping learners understand ideas rather than memorize translated sentences.

Whether it's a textbook paragraph, lecture notes, or study material from a PDF, EduArtha acts like a patient learning companion that simplifies the learning process.

# Powered by Gemma 4

EduArtha is built around **Google's Gemma 4**, enabling it to generate educational explanations instead of literal translations.

Each request follows a structured prompting pipeline where the model is instructed to:

- Identify the core concept.
- Ignore unnecessary wording.
- Explain ideas in simple Hindi.
- Preserve important English technical terms.
- Generate learner-friendly responses.

This approach allows EduArtha to provide explanations that are easier to understand while maintaining the educational context of the original content.
